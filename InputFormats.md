If a file format is not supported by Tesseract, you should use a third party software to convert it to another format that is supported by Tesseract.

### PDF

Tesseract does not support reading PDF files.

If you need to OCR PDF files, you should either convert them to another format or use [OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/).
